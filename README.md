# Python-Projects-POP1912
In this repo, I will try post my projects in Python (may be weekly? :P)

These are the list of Games/Projects till now - 

1. GuessTheNumber - 
    The user/player will be given 5 chances to guess a number which the program picked from 1 to 25(both inclusive) randomly.

    *learned something new*:
        We can import "random", and use "random.randint(start, end)" to generate random number b/w start and end numbers(including both).
    
2. jokes.py - 
    The program will tell you a 3 jokes, make sure to laugh, else the program will feel very bad :(.

    *learned something new*:
        Refreshed that we can still use ' in the print statement using */*'

# Python-Projects-POP1912
In this repo, I will try post my projects in Python (may be weekly? :P)

These are the list of Games/Projects till now - 

1. GuessTheNumber - 
    The user/player will be given 5 chances to guess a number which the program picked from 1 to 25(both inclusive) randomly.

    *learned something new*:
        We can import "random", and use "random.randint(start, end)" to generate random number b/w start and end numbers(including both).
    
2. jokes.py - 
    The program will tell you a 3 jokes, make sure to laugh, else the program will feel very bad :(.

    *learned something new*:
        Refreshed that we can still use ' in the print statement using */*'

3. gragon.py -
    In this game, the player must choose one of the two caves infornt of him. Both caves have treasures, which are protected by Dragons. But only a 'friendly' dragon will happily shares it's treasures, while the other dragon kill the player. 

    *learned something new*:
        we can import 'time' and using 'time.sleep(seconds)' will makes the program to wait the number of seconds, before going/executing to the next line/code!!!.

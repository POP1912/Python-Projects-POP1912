# Python-Projects-POP1912
In this repo, I will try post my projects in Python (may be weekly? :P)

These are the list of Games/Projects till now - 

1. GuessTheNumber - 
    The user/player will be given 5 chances to guess a number which the program picked from 1 to 25(both inclusive) randomly.

    *learned something new*:
        We can import "random", and use "random.randint(start, end)" o generate random number b/w start and end numbers.
